# Shadow Worker Validation Process

## Build Validation
- All builds must complete with zero warnings
- Compiler warnings are treated as errors (-Werror)
- ASAN/UBSAN checks enabled in debug builds
- Additional checks for `MapSystem` and `TextureManager`

## Structure Validation
- Memory alignment verified for all critical structures
- Boundary checks on all array accesses
- Type safety enforced through static analysis
- Validation of `ComponentRegistry` and `EntityPool` structures

## Functional Testing
- Unit tests for all core systems
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Tests for `MapSystem` and `TextureManager` integration

## Memory Management
- Memory leak detection through ASAN
- Resource cleanup verification
- Allocation tracking in debug builds

## Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must be documented
- Test coverage reports generated
- Memory usage patterns documented

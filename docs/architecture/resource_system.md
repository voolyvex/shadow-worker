# Resource Management System

## Current Status

⚠️ **Note:** The resource management system is currently in prototype phase. Tests are temporarily disabled (see GitHub issue #XXX).

## Overview

The resource management system handles all game assets including:
- Textures
- Audio (Music and Sound Effects)
- Fonts
- Shaders

## Architecture

### Resource Manager
- Centralized resource handling
- Reference counting
- Automatic cleanup
- Memory optimization

### Resource Types
```c
typedef struct {
    Texture2D texture;
    char* key;
    bool loaded;
} TextureResource;

typedef struct {
    Wave wave;
    char* key;
    bool loaded;
} WaveResource;

typedef struct {
    Music music;
    char* key;
    bool loaded;
} MusicResource;
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Loading Resources
```c
ResourceManager* manager = GetResourceManager();
bool success = LoadGameTexture(manager, "path/to/texture.png", "texture_key");
if (!success) {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Accessing Resources
```c
const Texture2D* texture = GetGameTexture(manager, "texture_key");
if (!texture) {
    // Handle missing resource
}
```

### Cleanup
```c
UnloadGameTexture(manager, "texture_key");
```

## Known Issues

1. Resource Manager Tests
   - Currently disabled during prototype phase
   - Will be re-enabled after core functionality stabilization
   - See GitHub issue #XXX for details

2. Memory Management
   - Reference counting implementation pending
   - Memory leak detection to be implemented
   - Automated cleanup system in development

## Future Improvements

1. Phase 1 (Current)
   - Basic resource loading/unloading
   - Error handling
   - Memory management

2. Phase 2 (Planned)
   - Resource pooling
   - Async loading
   - Resource streaming
   - Re-enable and expand test coverage

3. Phase 3 (Future)
   - Resource compression
   - Hot reloading
   - Resource versioning
   - Performance optimization

## Best Practices

1. Resource Loading
   - Always check return values
   - Use explicit error handling
   - Clean up resources when done
   - Follow the resource lifecycle

2. Memory Management
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Use resource pools for frequent operations
   - Avoid resource leaks

3. Error Handling
   - Log all resource operations
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Implement fallback resources
   - Handle out-of-memory conditions

# System Design Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The Shadow Worker game engine is built with a modular architecture focusing on performance, maintainability, and extensibility. The system is composed of several key subsystems that work together to create a cohesive game engine.

## Core Systems

### 1. Map System
The Map System manages the game world's tile-based environment:
- Chunk-based rendering for performance optimization
- Tile and object management
- Collision detection
- View culling
- Layer-based rendering

### 2. Entity System
Handles game objects and their behaviors:
- Entity pooling for efficient memory management
- Component-based architecture
- Entity lifecycle management
- Entity-entity interaction

### 3. Resource Management
Manages game assets and resources:
- Texture loading and caching
- Sound and music management
- Font management
- Resource lifecycle tracking

### 4. World System
Coordinates the overall game state:
- Integration of map and entity systems
- Physics simulation
- Camera management
- Game state persistence

## System Integration

### Component Communication
Systems communicate through well-defined interfaces:
```
World System
    ↓
    ├── Map System
    │   └── Chunk Cache
    │
    ├── Entity System
    │   └── Component Registry
    │
    └── Resource Manager
        └── Asset Cache
```

### Memory Management
- Pool-based allocation for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Reference counting for shared resources
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Memory leak detection in debug builds

### Performance Optimizations
1. Spatial partitioning for collision detection
2. View frustum culling
3. Texture atlasing
4. Object pooling
5. Chunk-based map rendering

## Build System
The project uses CMake for build configuration:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Dependency management
- Build configuration options
- Test integration

## Testing Framework
Comprehensive testing strategy:
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Memory leak detection
- Performance benchmarks

## Error Handling
Robust error management system:
- Error categorization
- Logging system
- Debug information
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Future Considerations

### Planned Improvements
1. Multi-threading support
2. Enhanced rendering pipeline
3. Network multiplayer support
4. Advanced physics simulation
5. Scripting system integration

### Scalability
The system is designed to scale through:
- Modular architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Efficient resource management
- Optimized data structures

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- raylib: Graphics and input handling
- GLFW: Window management
- Other standard C libraries

### Version Requirements

- CMake 3.10+
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Clear directory structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Documentation requirements
- Code review process
